Object collision between tanks and projectiles (and win conditions)
- Try to use a basic Pythagorean distance check
Basic game AI
- Pathfinding algorithm already implemented
- Need to program the AI to move according to the pathfinding algorithm

----------------
^ Technically this should hit MVP (or just about, due to janky implementation), but if there's time:

Replace current tank-wall, projectile-wall, and tank-projectile collision detection with linear algebra method
- Write Vector class, etc.
